## 1. About the Medical Research Future Fund 

### 1.1. Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) 

The MRFF, established under the _Medical Research Future Fund Act 2015_ (MRFF Act), provides grants of financial assistance to support health and medical research and innovation to improve the health and wellbeing of Australians. It operates as an endowment fund with the capital preserved in perpetuity. The MRFF reached maturity at $20 billion in July 2020. The MRFF provides a long-term sustainable source of funding for endeavours that aim to improve health outcomes, quality of life and health system sustainability. 

This MRFF investment is guided by the _Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy 2021 2026_ (the Strategy) and related set of _Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities 2022 2024_ (the Priorities), developed by the independent and expert Australian Medical Research Advisory Board following extensive national public consultation. 

### 1.2. About the Research Data Infrastructure Initiative 

The Research Data Infrastructure Initiative (the Initiative) forms part of the Fund. A total of $100 million over 10 years from 2022-23 for the Initiative. 

The objective of this initiative is to support strategic investments that establish and extend national research data infrastructure to support world-class health and medical research. 

Funding for this initiative supports the creation or extension of national research data infrastructure with a focus on data registries, biobanks and data linkage platforms to enable and enhance Australian medical research. This will include supporting infrastructure that makes evidence-based care easier for health professionals, drives efficient use of resources and advances healthcare. 

Further information on the rationale of the Initiative is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care website. 

The MRFF Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Strategy (the Evaluation Strategy) provides an overarching framework for assessing the performance of the MRFF and is publicly available on the MRFF website. Applicants to this grant opportunity are expected to describe how their proposed project aligns with the objectives and outcomes of the Research Data Infrastructure Initiative and the Measures of Success as described in the Evaluation Strategy. These will be key assessment criteria for funding. Projects funded from this grant opportunity will be monitored and evaluated against the Evaluation Strategy. 

For further details see sections 5 and 6. 

There will be other grant opportunities as part of this Initiative and we will publish the opening and closing dates and any other relevant information on business.gov.au and GrantConnect. 

We administer the MRFF according to the _Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines_ (CGRGs)^1.

### 1.3. About the 2023 Research Data Infrastructure Grant Opportunity 

These guidelines contain information for the 2023 Research Data Infrastructure Grant Opportunity. This grant opportunity was announced as part of the MRFF under the Research Data Infrastructure Initiative. 

Data is being collected and used at an exponential pace across a range of research sectors. Digital health uses data and information technology to support and enhance clinical safety, improve productivity and efficiency, and connect the health system. 

Data-intensive approaches are also vital to research that depends on data assets to access, generate, manipulate, share and repurpose research data to address major health challenges, for example emerging fields such as ‘big data’ in healthcare, bioinformatics, computational biology, metagenomics, artificial intelligence, precision medicine and new diagnostics. 

Current efforts continue to improve health care delivery and further advances are needed to improve data utilisation for more integrated and effective health and healthcare systems. Support for informatics (e.g. data registries, biobanks, data linkage platforms and secure data storage), artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics research, advanced clinical decision-making tools, wearables, and other emerging innovative digital technologies is the key to realising the benefits of healthcare digitalisation. 

There is potential for improved prevention, patient care, behavioural change, and care compliance through better access of existing data. This can be achieved by supporting research that leverages and enhances data platforms, linkage, data storage and analytics; applied artificial intelligence, end-user digital utility; and the development of novel decision tools. 

In particular, these approaches can be harnessed to address areas of unmet medical need. An unmet medical need arises where individuals are living with a serious health condition where there are limited satisfactory options for prevention, diagnosis or treatment to support improved health outcomes. 

The objective and intended outcome of this grant opportunity are aligned with the following _Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities 2022 2024 2_ 

▪ Research Infrastructure and Capability 

▪ Data, Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence 

Consistent with the _Medical Research Future Fund Act 2015_ , the objective of this grant opportunity is to provide grants of financial assistance to support Australian medical research and medical innovation projects that use novel methods to harness multiple existing data infrastructure types in developing and implementing new approaches for addressing an unmet medical need. 3. 

Examples of such projects may include (but are not limited to): 

▪ use of clinical quality registries 4 linked to other forms of research data infrastructure such as administrative datasets to generate new knowledge and/or actionable outcomes in an area of unmet medical need, noting that advances in epidemiological and biostatistical methods have 

(^2) Australian Medical Research and Innovation Priorities 20222024 (^3) Australian Medical Research and Innovation Strategy 20212026 (^4) Ahern et al., Realising the potential: leveraging clinical quality registries for real world clinical research. Medical Journal of Australia, Volume 216, Issue 6 p. 273277 


 broadened the scope of questions that can be addressed through observational studies such as registries 5. 

▪ using new methodologies to analyse existing complex linked datasets from multiple sources, or new linkages between existing datasets in populations that require large sample sizes or detailed data regarding priority populations 4 , with a focus on areas that will change practice. 

For the purposes of this grant opportunity, types of ‘research data infrastructure’ include clinical quality registries, biobanks, data collections, linkage platforms, data collection from wearables, use of artificial intelligence and informatics. 

To meet the objective of the grant opportunity projects proposed should articulate a clear research question that addresses an area of unmet medical need, and explain how the proposed project will produce knowledge and outcomes that address the research question. Research proposals should incorporate: 

▪ new linkage and/or use of data from multiple (at least two) existing research data infrastructure sources of different types (e.g. administrative and biobank data, registry and biobank data, wearables and use artificial intelligence); and/or 

▪ novel methodologies and approaches that leverage and enhance existing linked research data infrastructure of at least two different types (e.g. administrative and biobank data, registry and biobank data, wearables and use artificial intelligence). 

To be competitive for funding, applicants must propose to conduct research that delivers against the above objectives and those of the Research Data Infrastructure Initiative. Applicants are encouraged to propose novel and/or innovative research and describe how the outcomes of the research will be translated into health benefits for Australians. 

The intended outcome of the research funded by this grant opportunity is to improve the health and wellbeing of Australians by supporting Australian medical research and medical innovation projects that use multiple types of existing research data infrastructure in new ways in areas of existing or emerging unmet health need. 

This document sets out: 

▪ the eligibility and assessment criteria 

▪ how we consider and assess grant applications 

▪ how we notify applicants and enter into grant agreements with grantees 

▪ how we monitor and evaluate grantees’ performance 

▪ responsibilities and expectations in relation to the opportunity. 

The Department of Industry, Science and Resources (the department/we) is responsible for administering this grant opportunity on behalf of the Department of Health and Aged Care. 

_Impact of COVID19_

### 1.4. Encouraging Partnerships 

Applicants are encouraged to seek strategic partnerships with organisations whose decisions and actions affect Australians’ health, health policy and health care delivery in ways that improve the health of Australians. Organisations that are capable of implementing policy and service delivery and would normally not be able to access funding through most MRFF funding mechanisms are highly valued as partners. 

Partnerships and co-investment are encouraged in order to maximise impact of investment, provide opportunities for more mature sites/agencies to build the capacity of emerging sites/agencies, reduce duplication of activities, and reduce potential respondent administrative burden on participating communities. Partnerships are also encouraged to ensure the proposed research is of relevance to consumers and delivery of services, and to support translation of research outcomes into practice. 

Partner organisations include: 

▪ those working in federal, state, territory or local government – in the health portfolio or in other areas affecting health, such as economic policy, urban planning, education or transport 

▪ those working in the private sector such as employers, private health insurance providers or private hospitals 

▪ those commercial entities with an interest in this area, for example digital health technology companies 

▪ non-government organisations and charities 

▪ community organisations such as consumer groups 

▪ healthcare providers, and/or 

▪ professional groups. 

Partnerships with an overseas partner organisation are acceptable, provided the objectives of the grant opportunity are fully met. However, you cannot use the grant to cover retrospective costs or to support research projects undertaken outside of Australia (although funding can be sought to support the Australian-based components of multinational clinical trials). 

While partnerships are encouraged, they may not necessarily be relevant for all projects. Where relevant, partner funding contributions will contribute to the assessment of project impact and overall value and risk, but are not a requirement (see section 5). 

## 2. Grant amount and grant period 

For this grant opportunity, up to $ 10 million is available in 2023 24. 

Grant funds will be provided in 202324 ; however, grant funds can be expended across the life of the project (project period). See below and section 2.2.

### 3.4. Who is not eligible? 

You are not eligible to apply if you are: ▪ an individual ▪ partnership ▪ unincorporated association ▪ any organisation not included in section 3.1 ▪ trust (however, an incorporated trustee may apply on behalf of a trust) ▪ a non-corporate Commonwealth entity ▪ an organisation, or your project partner is an organisation, included on the National Redress Scheme’s website on the list of ‘Institutions that have not joined or signified their intent to join the Scheme’ (www.nationalredress.gov.au) ▪ an employer of 100 or more employees that has not complied with the Workplace Gender Equality Act (2012). 

## 4. What the grant money can be used for 

### 4.1. Eligible activities 

To be eligible your project must: ▪ be aimed at the objectives in Section 1.3 ▪ include one or more of the following eligible activities: ▪ development/installation of research equipment required for the synthesis, repurposing and transformation of existing research data infrastructure ▪ employment of personnel and/or ▪ other direct research costs. We may also approve other activities. 

### 4.2. Eligible locations 

We will consider activities based in any geographical location in Australia. You may request funding for a component of the research to be undertaken overseas if the equipment/resources required for that component are not available in Australia and the component is critical to the successful completion of the research project. However, the expectation is the majority of the research activities and funding expenditure will occur in Australia. 


### 4.3. Eligible expenditure 

You can only spend grant funds on eligible expenditure you have incurred on an agreed project as defined in your grant agreement. ▪ For guidance on eligible expenditure, see Appendix A. ▪ For guidance on ineligible expenditure, see Appendix B. If your application is successful, we may ask you to verify project costs that you provided in your application. You may need to provide evidence such as quotes for major costs. Not all expenditure on your project may be eligible for grant funding. The Program Delegate (who is an Australian Government official who has been authorised to make decisions) makes the final decision on what is eligible expenditure and may give additional guidance on eligible expenditure if required. To be eligible, expenditure must: ▪ be a direct cost of the project ▪ be incurred by you for required project audit activities. You must incur the project expenditure between the project start and end date for it to be eligible unless stated otherwise. You must not commence your project until you execute a grant agreement with the Commonwealth. 

## 5. The assessment criteria 

Grants funded under this grant opportunity are intended to support projects that progress research that addresses a specific health need. Applications will be assessed against the assessment criteria described below. You must address all assessment criteria in your application. We will assess your application based on the weighting given to each technical criterion and against the non-weighted (non-technical) assessment criterion. The application form requests information that directly relates to the assessment criteria below. The amount of detail and supporting evidence you provide in your application should be relative to the project size, complexity and grant amount requested. You should provide evidence to support your responses to each criterion. Size limits apply to all responses. We will only award funding to applications that score satisfactorily against all criteria. 

### 5.1. Assessment Criterion 1 Project Impact ( 40 % weighting) 

Project Impact is the extent to which the project’s research outputs will contribute to meaningful advances in health outcomes, practice and/or policy, consistent with the objectives and outcomes described in section 1.3. The assessment of Project Impact will also consider the project’s contribution to the objective of the Initiative as described in section 1.2 and your statement against the MRFF Measures of Success. In your response to this criterion, you should ensure that you: 


▪ describe how the project builds upon existing knowledge to progress the area of research and how the research outcomes will contribute to meaningful advances in health outcomes, practice and/or policy in Australia. ▪ clearly outline how the proposed project will produce knowledge and outcomes that address an area of unmet medical need. ▪ demonstrate how the views and values of consumers, the community, health providers and/or other end users have informed the proposed research, including how the needs and priorities of consumers (particularly those with lived experience and their carers) have informed the research question. ▪ demonstrate the involvement of academic, industry, state/territory, and/or other partners in the project and how their needs and views have informed its conceptualisation, development and planned translation and implementation. In addition, projects that specifically focus on the health of priority populations (defined as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, older people experiencing diseases of ageing, people with rare or currently untreatable diseases/conditions, people in remote/rural communities, people with a disability, individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, LGBTIQ+ people, youth) should: ▪ describe how the anticipated outputs will contribute to meaningful advances in health outcomes, practice and/or policy for the priority population ▪ demonstrate how the proposed research focuses on interventions that will be acceptable (e.g. culturally appropriate) to the priority population ▪ demonstrate leadership by, and involvement of, the priority population in the project, and how their needs, views and values have informed its conceptualisation, development and planned implementation. Further instructions are in section 6. 1. 

### 5.2. Assessment Criterion 2 Project methodology ( 30 % weighting) 

Project Methodology is a description of the design and conduct of the proposed research in the form of a project plan. The assessment of Project Methodology will consider the scientific quality and feasibility of the project plan and its ability to deliver on the project’s intended outcomes. Projects are expected to be original and build on (rather than duplicate) research that has already been undertaken. In your response to this criterion, you should ensure you clearly: ▪ articulate the research question and the proposed approach for addressing it, including (as appropriate) tools and techniques, participants (e.g. diversity of participants), interventions, controls, statistical approaches, and strategies for data collection and use, including: ▪ demonstrate new linkage and/or use of data from multiple (at least two) existing research data infrastructure sources of different types (e.g. administrative and biobank data, registry and biobank data, wearables and use artificial intelligence); and/or ▪ outline novel methodologies and approaches that leverage and enhance existing linked research data infrastructure of at least two different types ▪ articulate how consumers will be involved in the proposed research, including their contributions throughout the life of the project ▪ articulate arrangements for project governance and oversight to support its successful delivery 


▪ articulate appropriate milestones, performance indicators and timeframes. In addition, projects that specifically focus on the health of priority populations should also articulate how the proposed methodology includes strong and meaningful leadership and involvement of the priority population, including its people, communities and organisations. Grantees will be required to report on project progress at 12 month intervals. Further instructions are in section 6. 1. 

### 5.3. Assessment Criterion 3 Capacity, capability and resources to deliver the 

### project ( 30 % weighting) 

Capacity, Capability and Resources is the relevant skills, knowledge, experience and resources the research team and any partners are contributing to the project. The assessment of Capacity, Capability and Resources will consider the overall composition of the research team, the contribution of individual researchers to the project, and the involvement of partners in the successful delivery of the project. In your response to this criterion, you should ensure that you demonstrate: ▪ the research team has an appropriate mix of skills (scientific, project management, etc) to undertake the proposed research ▪ the research team includes individuals that bring diverse experiences and expertise (e.g. across disciplines, genders, cultures, lived experience relevant to the research question, career stages and research sectors) ▪ the research team has the skills, experience and capacity to involve and support consumers (including those with lived experience) in the proposed research, and ensure that this is done appropriately and effectively ▪ the commitment of partners to the project and how they will support (through financial and inkind contributions) its successful delivery. In addition, projects that specifically focus on the health of priority populations should demonstrate that the research team includes leadership by the priority population, and that the research team has experience in delivering research that has positively impacted health policies and programs of relevance to the priority population. Each Chief Investigator should provide an example from within the last five years of how their research has contributed to meaningful advances in health outcomes, practice and/or policy through the translation or implementation of research findings. Further instructions are in section 6. 1. 

### 5.4. Assessment Criterion 4 Overall Value and Risk of the Project (non

### weighted) 

Overall Value and Risk is the extent to which the project’s research outputs will meaningfully contribute to the objective/s and intended outcomes of the grant opportunity, the Initiative, and the MRFF more broadly. Your response to this criterion will consist of your Measures of Success statement, proposed budget, and risk management plan submitted with your application. The assessment of Overall Value and Risk will consider: ▪ the relative contribution of the outcomes or results you have identified in your Measures of Success statement to the intended outcomes of the grant opportunity, the goal and aims of the Initiative, and the MRFF 


▪ the appropriateness of the requested budget (including the value and type of any contributions from partners) to support successful delivery of the project, including whether it is sufficiently detailed and justified and represents value with relevant money ▪ the appropriateness of the risk management plan, including strategies for identifying, documenting, monitoring and reporting on key risks to the completion of the project. Refer section 6. 1 and to the Rating Scale for Overall Value and Risk for further information. 

### 5.5. Consumer and community involvement 

The Statement on Consumer and Community Involvement in Health and Medical Research (the Statement) has been developed because of the important contribution consumers make to health and medical research. The Statement’s purpose is to guide research institutions, researchers, consumers and community members in the active involvement of consumers and community members in all aspects of health and medical research. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Consumers Health Forum of Australia Ltd worked in partnership with consumers and researchers to develop the Statement. Further information on the Statement is available on NHMRC’s website. Researchers are actively encouraged to involve consumers at all stages and levels of their proposed research, including in defining the research question and through the life of the proposed research and its translation.

### 6.3. Timing of the grant opportunity process 

You can only submit an application between the published opening and closing dates. We cannot accept late applications. Table 1: Expected timing for this grant opportunity Activity Timeframe 

Assessment of applications (^14) weeks Approval of outcomes of selection process (^8) weeks Negotiations and award of grant agreements (^) 4 weeks Notification to unsuccessful applicants 2 weeks Earliest start date of project (^) Date of execution of your grant agreement End date of grant commitment (^) Within 4 years of execution of the grant agreement 

## 7. The grant selection process 

We first review your application against the eligibility criteria. If eligible, we will then assess it against the assessment criteria. Only eligible applications will proceed to the assessment stage. We refer your application to an independent committee of experts (the Committee). For the 2023 Research Data Infrastructure Grant Opportunity, the Committee will comprise national and international experts. The Committee will undertake the assessment in accordance with the CGRG’s and consider your application on its merits, based on: ▪ how well it meets the criteria ▪ whether it provides value with relevant money. When assessing the merits of your application against the three technical (weighted) assessment criteria, the Committee will use the rating scale at Appendix C. Rating of the non-technical (Overall Value and Risk of your project) assessment criterion will be done in accordance with the Rating Scale at Appendix D. To be awarded MRFF funding, applications must receive a rating of 5 or higher against each of the weighted technical assessment criteria (Criteria 1, 2 and 3), and a rating of ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ for the non-weighted assessment criterion. When assessing whether the application represents value with relevant money, the Committee will have regard to: 


▪ the overall objective/s to be achieved ▪ the value of the grant sought ▪ extent to which the application matches identified MRFF priorities ▪ the extent to which the application demonstrates that funding will assist to meeting the proposal outcomes/objectives. The Committee will provide the Program Delegate with a report of the assessment outcomes. If the selection process identifies unintentional errors in your application, we may contact you to correct or clarify the errors, but you cannot make any material alteration or addition. 

### 7.1. Who will approve grants? 

The Program Delegate decides which grants to approve taking into account the recommendations of the committee, the availability of grant funds and the geographical spread of projects across Australia. The Program Delegate’s decision is final in all matters, including: ▪ the grant approval ▪ the grant funding to be awarded ▪ any conditions attached to the offer of funding. We cannot review decisions about the merits of your application. The Program Delegate will not approve funding if there is insufficient program funds available across relevant financial years for the grant opportunity. 

## 8. Notification of application outcomes 

We will advise you of the outcome of your application in writing. If you are successful, we will advise you of any specific conditions attached to the grant, including the timing of any public communications you make regarding being awarded a grant. If you are unsuccessful, we will give you an opportunity to discuss the outcome with us. 

## 9. Successful grant applications 

### 9.1. The grant agreement 

You must enter into a legally binding grant agreement with the Commonwealth. A sample grant agreement is available on business.gov.au and GrantConnect. We must execute a grant agreement with you before we can make any payments. Execute means both you and the Program Delegate have signed the agreement. We are not responsible for any expenditure you incur until a grant agreement is executed. You must not start any project activities until a grant agreement is executed. The approval of your grant may have specific conditions determined by the assessment process or other considerations made by the Program Delegate. We will identify these in the offer of grant funding. If you enter an agreement under this grant opportunity, you cannot receive other grants for the same activities from other Commonwealth, State or Territory granting programs. 


The Commonwealth may recover grant funds if there is a breach of the grant agreement. We will use a standard grant agreement. You will have 30 days from the date of a written offer to execute this grant agreement with the Commonwealth. During this time, we will work with you to finalise details. The offer may lapse if both parties do not sign the grant agreement within this time. Under certain circumstances, we may extend this period. We base the approval of your grant on the information you provide in your application. We will review any required changes to these details to ensure they do not impact the project as approved by the Program Delegate. 

### 9.2. Grant agreement variations 

We recognise that unexpected events may affect project progress. In these circumstances, you can request a variation to your grant agreement, including: ▪ changing project milestones ▪ extending the timeframe for completing the project ▪ changing project activities. The program does not allow for an increase of grant funds. If you want to propose changes to the grant agreement, you must put them in writing before the project end date. We can provide you with a variation request template. If a delay in the project causes milestone achievement and payment dates to move to a different financial year, you will need a variation to the grant agreement. We can only move funds between financial years if there is enough program funding in the relevant year to allow for the revised payment schedule. If we cannot move the funds, you may lose some grant funding. You should not assume that a variation request will be successful. We will consider your request based on factors such as: ▪ how it affects the project outcome ▪ consistency with the program policy objective, grant opportunity guidelines and any relevant policies of the department ▪ changes to the timing of grant payments ▪ availability of program funds. 

### 9.3. Project specific legislation, policies and industry standards 

You must comply with all relevant laws and regulations in undertaking your project. You must also comply with the specific legislation/policies/industry standards that follow. It is a condition of the grant funding that you meet these requirements. We will include these requirements in your grant agreement. Wherever the government funds research activities, the following special regulatory requirements may apply: ▪ MRFF Act 2015^7 ▪ Working with Vulnerable People registration 

(^7) https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2015A00116 


▪ State/Territory legislation in relation to working with children ▪ Ethics and research practices: ▪ the NHMRC/ARC/UA Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (2018) and successor documents ▪ the NHMRC/ARC/UA National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007, updated 2018) ▪ the Australian Code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes (2013) endorsed by the NHMRC, the ARC, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and UA. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between a successor document and its predecessor, then the successor document prevails. 

#### 9.3.1. Child safety requirements 

You must comply with all relevant legislation relating to the employment or engagement of anyone working on the project that may interact with children, including all necessary working with children checks. You must implement the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations endorsed by the Commonwealth and available at: https://www.humanrights.gov.au/national-principles-child-safeorganisations. You will need to complete a risk assessment to identify the level of responsibility for children and the level of risk of harm or abuse, and put appropriate strategies in place to manage those risks. You must update this risk assessment at least annually. You will also need to establish a training and compliance regime to ensure personnel are aware of, and comply with, the risk assessment requirements, relevant legislation including mandatory reporting requirements and the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations. You will be required to provide an annual statement of compliance with these requirements in relation to working with children. 

### 9.4. Intellectual property rights 

Applicants must provide details of intellectual property (IP) arrangements in their applications. This includes both the use of IP in the project and the proposed ownership rights to IP generated by the project as well as strategies for protecting Australia’s interests. Where IP is likely to be generated by the project, successful applicants are required to conclude protocols or contracts with their collaborating partners on the management of IP issues. These agreements should be in accordance with laws and regulations in Australia. 

### 9.5. Dissemination of research outcomes 

You must ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect patient privacy, intellectual property and commercially confidential information. Except where publication may compromise your obligations with respect to patient privacy, intellectual property and/or commercially confidential information, grantees are required to: ▪ if a clinical trial, submit the clinical trial protocol to an open access repository within six months of HREC approval, or publish a protocol manuscript as soon as practicable. 


▪ within 12 months of completion of the grant activity, disseminate the research findings through: ▪ ensuring that research findings are available in an open access repository ▪ content specific forums ▪ submission to peer-reviewed journals. ▪ make lay summaries available to research participants, concurrently with sharing and dissemination of research results. Grantees are encouraged to publish de-identified research data following completion of the grant in an open access repository and in accordance with best practice. 

### 9.6. How we pay the grant 

The grant agreement will state the: ▪ maximum grant amount we will pay ▪ proportion of eligible expenditure covered by the grant (grant percentage) ▪ any in-kind contributions you will make ▪ any financial contribution provided by you or a third party. We will not exceed the maximum grant amount under any circumstances. If you incur extra costs, you must meet them yourself. We will make payments according to an agreed schedule set out in the grant agreement. Payments are subject to satisfactory progress on the project. 

### 9.7. Grants Payments and GST 

If you are registered for the Goods and Services Tax (GST), where applicable we will add GST to your grant payment and provide you with a recipient created tax invoice. You are required to notify us if your GST registration status changes during the project period. GST does not apply to grant payments to government related entities^8. Grants are assessable income for taxation purposes, unless exempted by a taxation law. We recommend you seek independent professional advice on your taxation obligations or seek assistance from the Australian Taxation Office. We do not provide advice on tax. 

## 10. Announcement of grants 

We will publish non-sensitive details of successful projects on GrantConnect. We are required to do this by the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines unless otherwise prohibited by law. We may also publish this information on business.gov.au. This information may include: ▪ name of your organisation ▪ title of the project ▪ description of the project and its aims ▪ amount of grant funding awarded and grant duration

We will remind you of your reporting obligations before a report is due. We will expect you to report on: ▪ progress against agreed project milestones and MRFF Measures of Success ▪ risks arising during the project ▪ project expenditure, including expenditure of grant funds ▪ information about your project that supports evaluation of the MRFF. The amount of detail you provide in your reports should be relative to the project size, complexity and grant amount. We will monitor the progress of your project by assessing reports you submit and may conduct site visits to confirm details of your reports if necessary. Occasionally we may need to re-examine claims, seek further information or request an independent audit of claims and payments. 

#### 11.2.1. Progress reports 

Progress reports must: ▪ include evidence to demonstrate progress against the outcome/s and result/s identified in your Measures of Success statement (see section 6.1) ▪ include details of your progress towards completion of agreed project activities, including any risks arising and how they are being managed to ensure planned project outcomes are met 


▪ show the total expenditure incurred to date ▪ be submitted by the report due date ▪ include information about your project that supports evaluation of the MRFF. We will only make grant payments when we receive satisfactory progress reports. You must discuss any project or milestone reporting delays with us as soon as you become aware of them. 

#### 11.2.2. End of project report 

When you complete the project, you must submit an end of project report. End of project reports must: ▪ include evidence to demonstrate achievement of the outcome/s and result/s identified in your Measures of Success statement (see section 6.1) ▪ include the agreed evidence as specified in the grant agreement (including, but not limited to, evidence of project impact) ▪ identify the total expenditure incurred for the project ▪ include information about your project that supports evaluation of the MRFF ▪ include a declaration that the grant money was spent in accordance with the grant agreement and to report on any underspends of the grant money ▪ be submitted by the report due date. 

#### 11.2.3. Ad-hoc reports 

We may ask you for ad-hoc reports on your project. This may be to provide an update on progress, or any significant delays or difficulties in completing the project, or to support evaluation of the MRFF. 

### 11.3. Independent audits 

We may ask you to provide an independent audit report. An audit report would verify that you spent the grant in accordance with the grant agreement. The audit report requires you to prepare a statement of grant income and expenditure. The report template is available on business.gov.au and GrantConnect. 

### 11.4. Compliance visits 

We may visit you during the project period, or at the completion of your project to review your compliance with the grant agreement. We may also inspect the records you are required to keep under the grant agreement. For large or complex projects, we may visit you after you finish your project. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any compliance visit. 

### 11.5. Evaluation 

The Department of Health and Aged Care will evaluate the grant to measure how well the outcomes and objectives have been achieved. We may use information from your application and project reports for this purpose, and for the purpose of the evaluation of MRFF more broadly. We may also interview you, or ask you for more information to help us understand how the grant impacted you and to evaluate how effective the program was in achieving its outcomes. 


We may contact you up to two years after you finish your project for more information to assist with this evaluation, or the evaluation of MRFF more broadly. 

### 11.6. Grant acknowledgement 

If you make a public statement about a project funded under the grant opportunity, including in a brochure or publication, you must acknowledge the grant by using the following: ‘This project received grant funding from the Australian Government.’ If you erect signage in relation to the project, the signage must contain an acknowledgement of the grant. 

## 12. Probity 

We will make sure that the grant opportunity process is fair, according to the published guidelines, incorporates appropriate safeguards against fraud, unlawful activities and other inappropriate conduct and is consistent with the CGRGs. 

### 12.1. Conflicts of interest 

Any conflicts of interest could affect the performance of the grant opportunity or program. There may be a conflict of interest, or perceived conflict of interest, if our staff, any member of a committee or advisor and/or you or any of your personnel: ▪ has a professional, commercial or personal relationship with a party who is able to influence the application selection process, such as an Australian Government officer or member of an external panel ▪ has a relationship with or interest in, an organisation, which is likely to interfere with or restrict the applicants from carrying out the proposed activities fairly and independently, or ▪ has a relationship with, or interest in, an organisation from which they will receive personal gain because the organisation receives a grant under the grant program/ grant opportunity. As part of your application, we will ask you to declare any perceived or existing conflicts of interests or confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, there is no conflict of interest. If you later identify an actual, apparent, or perceived conflict of interest, you must inform us in writing immediately. Conflicts of interest for Australian Government staff are handled as set out in the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct (Section 13(7))^9 of the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth)^10. Committee members and other officials including the decision maker must also declare any conflicts of interest. We publish our conflict of interest policy on the department’s website^11.

## 13. Glossary 

 Term Definition Administering entity When an entity that is not responsible for the policy, is responsible for the administration of part or all of the grant application processes. Application form The document or computerised submission system that applicants use to apply for funding under the grant opportunity. Assessment criteria Are the specified principles or standards, against which applications will be judged. These criteria are also used to assess the merits of proposals and, in the case of a competitive grant opportunity, to determine application rankings. Chief Investigator A member of the research team. Chief Investigator A The member of the research team that takes the lead role in conducting the project and reporting on the outcomes of the project as specified in the grant agreement. Commencement date The expected start date for the grant activity. Committee The body established by the Department to consider and assess eligible applications and make recommendations for funding under the program. Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines (CGRGs) Establish the overarching Commonwealth grants policy framework and articulate the expectations for all noncorporate Commonwealth entities in relation to grants administration. Under this overarching framework, noncorporate Commonwealth entities undertake grants administration based on the mandatory requirements and key principles of grants administration. Completion date The expected date by which the grant activity must be completed and the grant spent Date of effect Can be the date on which a grant agreement is signed or a specified starting date. Decision maker The person who makes a decision to award a grant. Department The Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Eligibility criteria Refer to the mandatory criteria which must be met to qualify for a grant. Assessment criteria may apply in addition to eligibility criteria. 


Term Definition Eligible activities The activities undertaken by a grantee in relation to a project that are eligible for funding support as set out in 4.1. Eligible application An application or proposal for services or grant funding for which the Program Delegate has determined is eligible for assessment in accordance with these guidelines. Eligible expenditure The expenditure incurred by a grantee on a project and which is eligible for funding support as set out in 4.2 and Appendix A. Grant activity/activities Refers to the project/tasks/services that the grantee is required to undertake. Grant agreement Sets out the relationship between the parties to the agreement, and specifies the details of the grant. GrantConnect Is the Australian Government’s whole-of-government grants information system, which centralises the publication and reporting of Commonwealth grants in accordance with the CGRGs. Grantee The individual/organisation which has been selected to receive a grant. Grant funding or grant funds The funding made available by the Australian Government to grantees under the program. Grant opportunity Refers to the specific grant round or process where a Commonwealth grant is made available to potential grantees. A grant opportunity is aimed at achieving government policy outcomes under a Portfolio Budget Statement Program. Minister The Australian Government Minister for Health and Aged Care. Personal information Has the same meaning as in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) which is: Information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: a. whether the information or opinion is true or not; and b. whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. Program Delegate An Australian Government official in the Department of Health and Aged Care with responsibility for the grant opportunity. 


Term Definition Project A project described in an application for grant funding under this grant opportunity. 

Quote (^) A quote must contain the following information: ▪ organisation’s ABN ▪ Description of infrastructure works ▪ Itemised materials and costs ▪ Potential timeframe; and Indicates GST inclusive and exclusive amounts including GST exempt items if applicable. Value with relevant Money (^) Value with relevant money is a judgement based on the Grant Proposal representing an efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of public resources and determined from a variety of considerations. When administering a grant opportunity, the relevant financial and non-financial costs and benefits of each proposal are considered including, but not limited to: ▪ the quality of the project proposal and activities; ▪ fitness for purpose of the proposal in contributing to government objectives; ▪ that the absence of a grant is likely to prevent the grantee and government’s outcomes being achieved; and ▪ the potential grantee’s relevant experience and performance history. 


## Appendix A. Eligible expenditure 

This section provides additional guidance on the eligibility of expenditure referred to in Section 4.3. Applicants are encouraged to utilise existing research infrastructure to support their research wherever possible to reduce duplication and achieve the best return on project funding, and grant funds can be requested to support access to existing research facilities and infrastructure. Applicants are encouraged to consider utilising research infrastructure projects such as those funded by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). The NCRIS projects encompass a variety of infrastructure relevant to health research such as the Therapeutic Innovations Australia (TIA) project and the Population Health Research Network (PHRN) project. Further information including access and pricing is available at [http://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris.](http://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris.) Your approach to accessing research facilities or infrastructure may impact our assessment of the suitability and value for money of the requested budget. 

### How we verify eligible expenditure 

If your application is successful, we may ask you to verify project costs that you provided in your application when we negotiate your grant agreement. You may need to provide evidence such as quotes for major costs. The grant agreement will include details of the evidence you may need to provide when you achieve certain milestones in your project. This may include evidence related to eligible expenditure. If requested, you will need to provide the agreed evidence along with your progress reports. You must keep payment records of all eligible expenditure, and be able to explain how the costs relate to the agreed project activities. At any time, we may ask you to provide records of the expenditure you have paid. If you do not provide these records when requested, the expense may not qualify as eligible expenditure. At the end of the project, you will be required to provide an independent financial audit of all eligible expenditure from the project. 

### Equipment 

You may purchase equipment, provided you can demonstrate it is critical to meeting project objectives and outcome. Applicants can request funding to pay for equipment costing over $10,000 that is essential to the research. The total equipment requested cannot exceed $80,000. Applicants must clearly outline the total value of all items of equipment for each year, why the equipment is required for the proposed research and why the equipment cannot be provided by the institution. The applicant must be prepared to meet all service and repair costs in relation to equipment funded. Funds will not be provided for the purchase of computers except where these are an integral component of a piece of laboratory equipment or are of a nature essential for work in the research 


field, for example, a computer which is dedicated to data collection from a mass spectrometer, or used for the manipulation of extensively large datasets (i.e. requiring special hardware). 

### Labour expenditure 

Eligible labour expenditure for the grant covers the direct labour costs of employees you directly employ on the core elements of the project. We consider a person an employee when you pay them a regular salary or wage, out of which you make regular tax instalment deductions. We consider costs for technical, administrative and project management activities eligible labour expenditure, provided there are direct, demonstrated and monitored links to project objectives and outcomes. We consider labour expenditure for leadership or administrative staff (such as CEOs, CFOs, accountants and lawyers) as eligible expenditure, provided there are direct, demonstrated and monitored links to project objectives and outcomes. However, we limit these costs to 10 per cent of the total amount of eligible labour expenditure claimed. Where a case exists for labour expenditure of leadership or administrative staff to exceed this, approval must be sought from the Program Delegate. Eligible salary expenditure includes an employee’s total remuneration package as stated on their Pay As You Go (PAYG) Annual Payment Summary submitted to the ATO. We consider salarysacrificed superannuation contributions as part of an employee’s salary package if the amount is more than what the Superannuation Guarantee requires. The maximum salary for an employee, director or shareholder, including packaged components that you can claim through the grant is $1 7 5,000 per financial year. Requests can be made to the Program Delegate to exceed this amount on a case by case basis, where justified, and at the discretion of the Program Delegate. For periods of the project that do not make a full financial year, you must reduce the maximum salary amount you claim proportionally. You can only claim eligible salary costs when an employee is working directly on agreed project activities during the agreed project period. Commonwealth funded positions can be considered eligible to count towards an in-kind contribution. However, the Commonwealth funded position cannot also draw a salary from funds awarded through this grant opportunity for the same activity. 

### Labour on-costs 

You may include eligible salary costs such as employer paid superannuation, payroll tax, workers compensation insurance, and leave entitlements (including paid maternity leave, sick leave, long service leave and recreation leave). These costs must be reasonable and be separately identified in the project budget. You should calculate eligible salary costs using the formula below: 


You cannot calculate labour costs by estimating the employee’s worth. If you have not exchanged money (either by cash or bank transactions) we will not consider the cost eligible. Evidence you will need to provide can include: ▪ details of all personnel working on the project, including name, title, function, time spent on the project and salary ▪ ATO payment summaries, pay slips and employment contracts. 

### Contract expenditure 

Eligible contract expenditure is the cost of any agreed project activities that you contract others to do. These can include contracting: ▪ another organisation ▪ an individual who is not an employee, but engaged under a separate contract. All contractors must have a written contract prior to starting any project work—for example, a formal agreement, letter or purchase order which specifies: ▪ the nature of the work they perform ▪ the applicable fees, charges and other costs payable. Invoices from contractors must contain: ▪ a detailed description of the nature of the work ▪ the hours and hourly rates involved ▪ any specific plant expenses paid. Invoices must directly relate to the agreed project, and the work must qualify as an eligible expense. The costs must also be reasonable and appropriate for the activities performed. We will require evidence of contractor expenditure that may include: ▪ an exchange of letters (including email) setting out the terms and conditions of the proposed contract work ▪ purchase orders ▪ supply agreements ▪ invoices and payment documents. You must ensure all project contractors keep a record of the costs of their work on the project. We may require you to provide a contractor’s records of their costs of doing project work. If you cannot provide these records, the relevant contract expense may not qualify as eligible expenditure. 

### Travel and overseas expenditure 

Eligible travel and overseas expenditure may include: ▪ domestic travel limited to the reasonable cost of accommodation and transportation required to conduct agreed project and collaboration activities in Australia 


▪ domestic travel for third parties , where the travel is essential to the successful completion of the grant activity ▪ overseas travel, where it is formally documented and agreed by the Delegate, as essential to the conduct of the project, in advance of the travel being taken and is limited to the reasonable cost of accommodation and transportation ▪ applicants may request funding for a component of the research to be undertaken overseas if the equipment/resources required for that component are not available in Australia and the component is critical to the successful completion of the research project. However, the expectation is the majority of the research activities and funding expenditure will occur in Australia. Eligible air transportation is limited to the economy class fare for each sector travelled; where noneconomy class air transport is used: ▪ only the equivalent of an economy fare for that sector is eligible expenditure ▪ the grantee will require evidence showing what an economy air fare costs at the time of travel ▪ grant funding only up to the economy air fare cost at the time of travel amount can be used. When considering an application for overseas travel, the Delegate will undertake a Value for Money assessment to determine whether the cost of overseas expenditure is eligible. This may depend on: ▪ the proportion of total grant funding that you will spend on overseas expenditure ▪ the proportion of the service providers total fee that will be spent on overseas expenditure ▪ how the overseas expenditure is likely to aid the project in meeting the program objectives. Eligible overseas activities expenditure is generally limited to 10 per cent of total eligible project expenditure. Where the amount exceeds 10 per cent, Program Delegate approval must be sought. 

### Other eligible expenditure 

Other eligible expenditures include costs directly related to the project activity that are not already being supported through any other sources, or where other Commonwealth, state or territory governments do not have primary responsibility, including: ▪ staff training that directly supports the achievement of project outcomes ▪ financial auditing of project expenditure ▪ costs you incur in order to obtain planning, environmental or other regulatory approvals during the project period. However, associated fees paid to the Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments are not eligible ▪ insurances which are specifically required to cover the grant activity ▪ accessing intellectual property (IP) expertise and supporting the protection of IP. ▪ Other specific expenditures may be eligible as determined by the Program Delegate. Evidence you need to supply can include supplier contracts, purchase orders, invoices and supplier confirmation of payments. 


## Appendix B. Ineligible expenditure 

This section provides guidance on what we consider ineligible expenditure. The Program Delegate may impose limitations or exclude expenditure, or further include some ineligible expenditure listed in these guidelines in a grant agreement or otherwise by notice to you. Examples of ineligible expenditure include: ▪ maintenance or upgrades on buildings or structures ▪ activities, equipment or supplies that are already being supported through other sources or where other Commonwealth, state or territory governments have primary responsibility ▪ reimbursement of activities that have commenced prior to the execution of a grant agreement ▪ research activity undertaken outside of Australia, although funding can be sought to support the Australian-based components of multi-national research activity ▪ costs incurred prior to the agreed project start date ▪ retrospective costs ▪ any in-kind contributions ▪ financing costs, including interest ▪ debt financing ▪ costs related to obtaining resources used on the project, including interest on loans, job advertising and recruiting, and contract negotiations ▪ non-project related staff training and development costs ▪ costs related to preparing the grant application, preparing any project reports (except costs of independent audit reports we require) and preparing any project variation requests ▪ conference attendance, and associated travel (except in pre-approved circumstances where the research outputs of the activity are to be presented) ▪ travel or overseas costs that exceed 10 per cent of total project costs except where otherwise approved by the Program Delegate (see above) ▪ health insurance, travel insurance, foreign currency, airport and related travel taxes, passports and visas ▪ entertainment and hospitality costs ▪ personal subscriptions (e.g. personal journal subscriptions) ▪ personal membership of professional organisations and groups ▪ airline club membership ▪ communications costs (mobiles, telephone calls) ▪ institutional overheads and administrative costs. This list is not exhaustive and applies only to the expenditure of the grant funds. Other costs may be ineligible where we decide that they do not directly support the achievement of the planned outcomes for the project or that they are contrary to the objective of the grant opportunity. You must ensure you have adequate funds to meet the costs of any ineligible expenditure associated with the project. 


## Appendix C. Assessment scoring scale 

When assessing the merits of your application against the assessment criteria, the Committee will use the following ten-point scale (10 highest, 1 lowest). Score Rating Scale 10 Excellent Quality – response to this criterion significantly exceeds expectations. Evidence confirms consistent superior performance against this criterion in all areas. Claims are fully substantiated. 9 Outstanding Quality response to this criterion exceeds expectations in most key areas and addressed to a very high standard in others. Most Claims are fully substantiated with others very well substantiated. 8 Very Good Quality response to this criterion meets expectations to a very high standard in all areas. All claims are well substantiated. 7 Good Quality – response to this criterion meets expectations to a high standard in all areas. Claims are well substantiated in key areas. 6 Fair Quality^ –^ response to this criterion addresses all areas well. Claims are well substantiated in most areas. Some minor shortcomings. 5 Acceptable Quality – response addresses most key areas to a consistent acceptable standard with no major shortcomings. Most claims are adequately substantiated. Some proposals may be questionable. 4 Marginal Quality – response is marginal and does not fully meet expectations. Some claims unsubstantiated; others only adequately substantiated or lack sufficient detail. Some proposals may be unworkable. 3 Poor Quality – response poorly addresses some areas or fails to address some areas. Claims largely unsubstantiated. A number of proposals may be unworkable. 2 Very Poor Quality – response inadequately deals with most or all areas. Claims almost totally unsubstantiated. A number of proposals may be unworkable. 1 Unacceptable Quality – response does not meet expectations. Criteria not addressed or insufficient or no information to assess the criterion. Claims unsubstantiated, no evidence and unworkable.

- The stated approach to the management, monitoring and reporting of risks is clearly     articulated within their application. 

- Any risks arising through the assessment are tolerable and well mitigated, and not     likely to adversely impact on the achievement of stated objectives of the project. Good •^ The application provides^ good^ overall value. 

- The outcome/s or result/s against which the project’s contribution to the MRFF     measures of success will be evaluated are articulated reasonably clearly and are     somewhat aligned with the overall goals of the MRFF, the initiative and the grant     opportunity. 

- The proposed budget, with some minor shortcomings, is substantiated and will meet     the scope and scale of the proposed project. 

- The applicants risk management plan is appropriate to the project, with some minor     shortcomings. 

- The stated approach to the management, monitoring and reporting of risk is     articulated within their application, with claims supported across key areas. 

- Any risks arising through the assessment are tolerable and unlikely to adversely     impact on the achievement of stated objectives of the project, although some risks     may require additional mitigations and/or monitoring to ensure the delivery of project     outcomes. Marginal •^ The application provides^ marginal^ overall value. 

- The outcome/s or result/s against which the project’s contribution to the MRFF     measures of success will be evaluated are not clearly articulated and do not align     with the overall goals of the MRFF, the initiative and the grant opportunity. 

- The proposed budget is higher than expected for a project of the same scale and     scope, with some line items questionable. 

- The applicant’s risk management plan lacks detail in some areas, there are some     gaps in risk identification or analysis or some mitigation and management strategies     appear questionable. 

- Some risks arising through the assessment may require additional mitigation and/or     monitoring to ensure that they are managed in a way that doesn’t impact on the     delivery of some project outcomes.
